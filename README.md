# 👗 Fashion MNIST Image Classification

An end-to-end deep learning project that classifies **Fashion MNIST clothing images** into 10 categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
This project includes model development, evaluation, and a simple Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model capable of recognizing fashion items such as shirts, sneakers, bags, trousers, and more.

### 🔍 Key Features
- Trained on the **Fashion MNIST dataset**
- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- CNN architecture for better feature extraction
- Real-time prediction using a **Streamlit web app**
- Clean and modular code structure
- Easy-to-use interface for uploading images

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:

- Conv2D layers  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Flatten layer  
- Dense hidden layers  
- Softmax output layer  

Optimized using:
- **Adam optimizer**
- **Sparse categorical crossentropy**
- **Accuracy metric**
